# net-set

Net-set is a colorful, fast-paced, competitive card game you play in the browser. It's inspired by the real-life card game [SetÂ®](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)).

The game is written in JavaScript using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/). It uses [mori](http://swannodette.github.io/mori/) for immutable data structures and functional programming principles.  It was developed using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) for BDD.
