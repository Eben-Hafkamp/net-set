# net-set

Net-set is a colorful, fast-paced, competitive card game you play in the browser. It's inspired by the real-life card game [SetÂ®](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)). 

The game is written in JavaScript using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/). It uses [mori](http://swannodette.github.io/mori/) to adhere as closely as possible to functional programming principles.
